the dispatch of plumber eggs on magpie, it is also a magpie eggs.

## Design

1. jobs and tasks life cycle only forward, no backward. So logic will be easy.
2. if jobs' or tasks' status is wrong, interrupt and clean all, and tell caller error.
3. retry. every part find itself exceptions, deal it(mostly retry), then tell status to caller.
